# Operating-Systems

In this course, we will be learning about the concepts on which modern operating systems, such as Unix-based Linux, BSD/MacOS, and others systems, as based on.  This includes system resource management, critical sections and mutual exclusion, semaphores, monitors, classical problems, deadlock; process scheduling, memory management; swapping; virtual memory, paging; file systems and operating system security. We structure this into the areas of virtualisation, concurrency, and persistence.  The course also includes aspects of operating security.
